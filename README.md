AMFExt (native) 0.9
===============

This project is focused on adjustments on the original AMFEXT project from Emanuele Ruffaldi posted on PECL. You can check it in this address: http://pecl.php.net/package/amfext.

The main purpose is to mantain compatibility with new versions of PHP.

This extension implements the ActionScript Message Format 
for encoding and decoding,both in AMF and AMF3 versions.
Information can be found in [0].

This extension provides two low level functions useful for
encoding and decoding objects into AMF format, but it does
not provide functions for managing the full message. An
example of implementation can be found in [1].

Details on the encoding process can be read in doc/encoding.txt

Documentation on the PHP function and the callbacks is in doc/amfextdoc.php

Constants for the flags that can be used in the encoding/decoding are in amfext.php
that can be included.
